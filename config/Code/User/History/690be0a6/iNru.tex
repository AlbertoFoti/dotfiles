    \textit{``Last time, I asked: `What does}
    \textbf{mathematics}\textit{ mean to you?',
    and some people answered: `The manipulation of numbers, the manipulation of
    structures.' \\
    And if I had asked what }\textbf{music}
    \textit{means to you, would you have answered: \\
    `The manipulation of notes'?''}
