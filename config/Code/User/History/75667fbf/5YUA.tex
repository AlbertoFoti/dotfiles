\chapter{Nominal Trajectory}

The \textit{Descent Module} (DM), during the EDL phase, can be modeled as a
six dof (6dof) autonomous system.

It has three coordinates (spherical) describing its position relative to the
$\mathcal{R}_{m}$ reference frame

        $$
            \textbf{x}_{CoM} = [\: r,\:\Lambda,\:\lambda \:]
        $$

\noindent Where $r$ is the radial position w.r.t. the center of the planet, $\Lambda$ and $\lambda$ are 
the longitude and the latitude respectively.
