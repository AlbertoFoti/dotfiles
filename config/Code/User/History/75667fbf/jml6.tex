\chapter{Nominal Trajectory}

The \textit{Descent Module} (DM), during the EDL phase, can be modeled as a
six dof (6dof) autonomous system.

It has three coordinates (spherical) describing its position relative to the
$\mathcal{R}_{m}$ reference frame

$$ x_{CoM} = \begin{bmatrix}
    r \\
    \Lambda \\
    \lambda
\end{bmatrix}$$
